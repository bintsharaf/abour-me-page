            <strong>My Coding Journey</strong>
            <br>
            It all started with a 'Hello, World!' and a dream. From tinkering with my first website to mastering the art of
            responsive design, I have journeyed through lines of code and pixels on screens to bring ideas to life. I have done
            several project, which resulted in sharpening my skills and fueling my passion for frontend development.

            <p>At the heart of my work is a commitment to user experience. I believe that a great website isn't just about looking
            good‚Äîit's about creating an intuitive, accessible, and seamless interaction that resonates with users.

            <strong>Behind the scene</strong>
            <br>
            I believe in a balance lifestyle. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest in web design, fashion
            designs or reading books. I'm a lifelong learner who thrives on collaboration and innovation.
