            <p>I am a Front â€“ end developer turning ideas into code.
            I weave the web with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. I am all about creating seamless user experiences that not

            My Coding Journey
            
            It all started with a 'Hello, World!' and a dream. From tinkering with my first website to mastering the art of
            responsive design, I have journeyed through lines of code and pixels on screens to bring ideas to life. I have done
            several project, which resulted in sharpening my skills and fueling my passion for frontend development.
